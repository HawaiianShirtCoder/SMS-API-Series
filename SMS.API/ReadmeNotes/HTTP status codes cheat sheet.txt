Any http codes starting with a 2xx = success
Any http codes starting with a 4xx = errors causes by the client (i.e. sending bad data, request a resource that does not exist)
Any http codes starting with 5xx = server errors :(  Often hardest to resolve - this is where a good level of logging is helpful!
